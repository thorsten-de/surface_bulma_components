# SurfaceBulmaComponents

A set of [Surface](https://github.com/msaraiva/surface/) components
based on [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). Extension to the set of simple components in [SurfaceBulma](https://github.com/surface-ui/surface_bulma)

**Note**: This is used to implement some internal applications and - as SurfaceBulma - is not a full-featured suite of components.

## Usage

SurfaceBulmaComponents is not public facing yet, so this git repo can be used
to add `surface_bulma_components` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:surface_bulma_components, github: "thorsten-de/surface_bulma_components"}
  ]
end
```
